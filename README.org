* Dotfiles

My personal configuration files. Some are probably generic enough to be reused,
some are probably not (spacemacs) but may still be useful to glean some snippets
or ideas from.

I'm currently on a [[https://github.com/powerline/powerline][powerline ]]kick, so I've pretty much powerlined
all_teh_things. You've been warned.

* Install/Setup

The directory structure is setup to make it easy to use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

Checkout the repo into your home directory. To install tmux configuration, for
example, just run =stow tmux= from the dotfiles directory. Stow will symlink
everything into the proper place.
